# ðŸª¼ NEvent 
**Clear and precise in-memory events for .NET.** 

### Philosophy: 
- âœ… **Zero magic**: No reflection, no complex pipelines. 
- âœ… **Async-first**: Designed for `async/await`. 
- âœ… **Memory-first**: Ideal for desktop apps, games, and internal modules. 

### When to use? 
- You need **uncoupled inter-component communication**. 
- You want **asynchronous events** with no overhead. 
- You prefer **full control** over the event flow.
